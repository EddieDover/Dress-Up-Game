# Random Character Generator

## Repository
https://github.com/StefMcCuistion/Randm-Character-Generator.git

## Description
A simple 2D random character generator. You know the 'randomize' feature in video game character creators, usually represented by a dice button? That's this whole game! After generating a character, you can save an image of them to your PC if you wish! 
This is the second attempt at the 'Dress Up RPG' project, whose repository can be found here:
