## Repository

## Description
A simple 2D random character generator. You know the 'randomize' function in video game character creators? That's this whole game! After generating a character, you can save an image of them to your PC if you wish! 
This is the second attempt at the 'Dress Up RPG' project, whose repository can be found here:
